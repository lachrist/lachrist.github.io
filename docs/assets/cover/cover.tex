I am currently completing my PhD at \ImplicitLink{https://soft.vub.ac.be/soft/index.html}{SOFT}, a research group at the VUB. My dissertation is under review, and the defense is planned for mid-September. In the meantime, I am eager to stay active professionally. I bring 13 years of combined experience in software R&D across both academia and industry.

\vspace{12pt}

After graduating in Civil Engineering from ULB in 2012, I spent eight years in academia conducting research focused on dynamic program analysis. With over 60 published npm packages and more than 650,000 total downloads, I have a strong track record of developing prototypes that have been adopted and extended by others. My flagship project, \ImplicitLink{https://github.com/lachrist/aran}{Aran}---a full-fledged JavaScript code instrumenter---has supported both internal and international collaborations and contributed to several publications.

\vspace{12pt}

Since 2020, I have worked as an independent consultant, leading multiple software R\&D projects. For most of this time, I contributed to \ImplicitLink{https://appmap.io}{AppMap}, a U.S.-based startup focused on runtime code analysis. There, I led the development of a JavaScript client designed to collect large volumes of execution data while integrating seamlessly into diverse deployment scenarios, including automated testing with Jest and Mocha. Over five years of industry consulting, I have developed strong software engineering skills, including agile methodologies, Git-based workflows, release pipelines, and more.

\vspace{12pt}

Through the prototypes and production systems I have developed over the years, I consider myself an excellent programmer with expert-level knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript. I am also seasoned in Haskell, having built several interpreters and compilers as part of my research, and taught it for seven years as a teaching assistant at the university. In addition, I am proficient with standard web technologies and languages such as SQL, Python, Java, and Ruby. I also have an interest in more esoteric languages, including Scheme and Prolog, which I have explored in the context of my research.
