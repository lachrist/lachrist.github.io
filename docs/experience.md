While research has been my main focus, I've also had the opportunity to work on interesting projects in the industry:

- I developed the JavaScript client for the AppMap tool suite. This tool uses instrumentation to collect large volumes of execution data and integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions, Node.js, Express, Mocha, and Jest. The CI/CD stack included Travis, semantic-release, Prettier, ESLint, and Mocha.
- I implemented the flame graph visualization for the AppMap suite. Built with Vue, the interface enables interactive exploration of the performance impact of function calls. It runs both in the browser and within VS Code. Automated testing was performed using Cypress and Chromatic.
- I built the prototype for EasyWanit, an Ionic mobile app that communicates with a Wanit device over a custom Bluetooth Low Energy protocol.
- I also developed several web applications using standard technologies:
  - Frontend: React, Vue, Ionic, Jekyll
  - Backend: Express, NestJS, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails
  - Database: MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL
  - Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure
