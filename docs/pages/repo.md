The following is a curated list of my personal repositories.

## Dynamic Program Analysis

Most of my current work focuses on dynamic program analysis, specifically on JavaScript.

- [aran](https://github.com/lachrist/aran): My flagship project, a JavaScript code instrumenter that serves as an infrastructure for building advanced dynamic program analyses such as taint analysis and concolic testing. Aran conducts sophisticated code transformations to desugar many JavaScript constructs. For instance, classes are represented as functions, which alleviates the need for the analysis to reason about them.
- [linvail](https://github.com/lachrist/linvail): A library built on top of Aran that can track primitive values across the object graph while supporting partial instrumentation. This capability was achieved by implementing an access control system using JavaScript's existing reflection API.
- [otiluke](https://github.com/lachrist/otiluke): A toolbox for deploying JavaScript code transformers, which are also written in JavaScript, on both Node.js and browsers. Node deployment is straightforward through the hook API, while browser deployment is more complex and requires performing a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and transform the code before it is executed by the browser.
- [virtual-proxy](https://github.com/lachrist/virtual-proxy): A library designed to alleviate some of the limitations of `Proxy`, the JavaScript reflection API. Proxies are objects that can override the default behavior of fundamental operations, such as property access. However, they are limited in that they must return data consistent with a hidden object called their target. This library keeps the hidden target in sync for the user.

## Program Interpretation

The [SICP book](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) has shaped my understanding of programming languages and convinced me that the best way to truly grasp a programming language is by building an interpreter for it. This approach has led me to develop several interpreters for my research.

- [cesk-labo](https://github.com/lachrist/cesk-labo): A CESK machine for interpreting programs in a minimal Scheme variant, designed to be configurable for different memory models. This flexibility allowed me to explore and illustrate the distinctions between primitive values and references in managed programming languages.
- [kusasa-hs](https://github.com/lachrist/kusasa-hs): A symbolic execution engine for a minimal Scheme variant, featuring a Haskell backend that explores the state space and a JavaScript-based GUI frontend for the browser.
- [prologjs](https://github.com/lachrist/prologjs): A interpreter written in JavaScript for a subset of Prolog. I created this project to solve constraints generated by the symbolic execution of programs.

## Network

Although my work primarily focuses on high-level programming languages, I also enjoy exploring lower abstraction levels, particularly in network programming.

- [posix-socket](https://github.com/lachrist/posix-socket): A library written in C++ that exposes the low-level API of POSIX sockets in JavaScript. I created this library to achieve truly synchronous inter-process communication while maintaining performance.
- [net-socket-messaging](https://github.com/lachrist/net-socket-messaging): A simple communication protocol for asynchronously exchanging messages between two processes using TCP sockets through `node:net`.
- [posix-socket-messaging](https://github.com/lachrist/posix-socket-messaging): Implements the same communication protocol as `net-socket-messaging`, but provides a synchronous API built on top of `posix-socket`.
- [mariaws](https://github.com/lachrist/mariaws): A server written in JavaScript that connects to a MariaDB database and communicates via the WebSocket protocol.

## VSCode

I'm experienced in developing VSCode extensions and have created several to assist me in my daily work.

- [latex-assistant](https://github.com/lachrist/vscode-latex-assistant): An assistant for writing LaTeX in VSCode, designed to support me with my forever ongoing PhD thesis.
- [listing-theme](https://github.com/lachrist/vscode-listing): A tool that extracts syntax highlighting as it appears in VSCode. This project was born from my frustration with replicating the same quality of highlighting in LaTeX using existing highlighters such as minted and listings.

## Coaching

I'm a swimming coach for the [NSG](https://www.sport.brussels/clubs/la-nage-saint-gilles/) swimming club in Brussels. Over the years, I have developed several tools to assist me in this endeavor.

- [abi-dalzim](https://github.com/lachrist/abi-dalzim): A training generator for dry land sessions. This tool helped me design and share training programs for at-home sessions and became very useful during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- [nsg-compet](https://github.com/lachrist/nsg-compet): A calendar for sharing competition dates, dry land workout sessions, and other important information with swimmers and their parents.
- [tictac](https://github.com/lachrist/tictac): A chronometer for timing my swimmers in various formats: internal, split, and broken. This tool has enabled me to provide high-quality feedback during training sessions and export the results to spreadsheets.
- [forgiving-splits](https://github.com/lachrist/forgiving-splits): Another chronometer for tracking my swimmers' laps during long-distance swims. Missing a lap in these sessions can be frustrating and undermine confidence in the results. This tool mitigates the issue by detecting discrepancies in lap split times, ensuring more reliable tracking.

## Miscellaneous

- [oghma](https://github.com/lachrist/oghma): A CLI tool for scraping citation graphs from Google Scholar. I created this tool to provide an objective overview of the state of the art in my research field.
- [parsecjs](https://github.com/lachrist/parsecjs): A straightforward adaptation of the excellent parser combinator library in Haskell. I used this library in various tools to parse whatever needed to be parsed.
