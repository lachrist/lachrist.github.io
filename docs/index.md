I'm a researcher and software engineer at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be), working in the [Software Languages Lab](https://soft.vub.ac.be). My research focuses on dynamic program analysis, particularly for JavaScript. I'm the author of [Aran](https://lachrist.github.io/aran/), an advanced JavaScript code instrumenter. I hold a master's degree in engineering from the [Universit√© libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/en), and my PhD in computer science from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is currently under review; I expect to graduate this summer.

As an enthusiastic software developer and open-source contributor, I specialize in JavaScript and TypeScript, but I'm also proficient in many mainstream programming languages, including SQL, Python, Ruby, C, C++, Java, and Scala. I also have experience with more esoteric languages, such as Scheme, Haskell, and Prolog.
