I'm a PhD student at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be) in the [Software Languages Lab](https://soft.vub.ac.be), where my research focuses on dynamic program analysis, specifically for JavaScript. I'm the author of [Aran](https://github.com/lachrist/aran), an advanced JavaScript code instrumenter.

While research has been my primary focus, I've spent numerous years teaching Functional Programming at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. I've also had the opportunity to lead several R&D projects, including developing the JavaScript client for the [AppMap](https://appmap.io) tool suite and creating the prototype for [EasyWanit](https://www.wanit.com/easywanit).

As an enthusiastic software developer, I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Haskell, with a strong interest in programming languages, compilers, and interpreters. I am also a passionate advocate for functional programming as a way to manage complexity.
