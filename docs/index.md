I'm a consultant and researcher at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be), working in the [Software Languages Lab](https://soft.vub.ac.be). My research focuses on dynamic program analysis, particularly for JavaScript. I'm the author of [Aran](https://github.com/lachrist/aran), an advanced JavaScript code instrumenter.

While research has been my main focus, I've also led several R&D projectsâ€”most notably developing the JavaScript client for the [AppMap](https://appmap.io) tool suite, and creating the prototype for [EasyWanit](https://www.wanit.com/easywanit).

As an enthusiastic software developer and open-source contributor, I specialize in JavaScript and TypeScript, but I'm also proficient in many other mainstream programming languages including SQL, C, C++, Java, and Python. I have experience with more esoteric languages as well, such as Scheme, Haskell, and Prolog.
