I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and I'm currently working as a Software Research Engineer at Sirris. My expertise includes: program analysis, language implementation, functional programming, and, more recently, generative AI.

After graduating in Civil Engineering from the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in 2012 with great distinction, I spent eight years conducting research at the Software Languages Lab (SOFT) of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), focusing on dynamic code analysis. I have a strong publication record, with papers presented at prestigious international conferences such as ICSME, SANER, and GIPCE. With over 60 published npm packages and more than 650,000 total downloads, I have a proven track record of building open-source prototypes that are widely adopted and extended by others. My flagship project, [Aran](https://lachrist.github.io/aran) (a full-fledged JavaScript code instrumenter) has supported both internal and international collaborations and contributed to multiple publications.

Between 2020 and 2025, I have worked as a consultant for the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). For most of this time, I contributed to [AppMap](https://appmap.io), a U.S.-based startup focused on runtime code analysis. There, I led the development of a JavaScript client for collecting large volumes of execution data, with seamless integration across server-side, client-side, and automated testing environments. I also contributed to several web- and mobile-based projects, including the development of the prototype for [EasyWanit](https://www.wanit.com/easywanit), a mobile application tasked with communicating via a custom Bluetooth protocol to a boiler. Over five years of industry consulting, I have developed strong software engineering skills, including agile methodologies, Git-based workflows, release pipelines, and continuous integration practices.

Since July 2025, I have been working as a Software Research Engineer at Sirris. In parallel, I continued my Ph.D. on provenance-aware dynamic analysis of JavaScript, which I successfully defended in January 2026. At Sirris, I am currently leading three research projects: [LISA](https://lisa-ai.be), which focuses on the risk and reliability of generative AI; [GENIUS](https://genius-itea.github.io), which aims to leverage generative AI during all phases of software development; and Antenna, which helps companies leverage [AI Factories](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-factories). I am also involved in several commercial projects. For instance, I had the opportunity to develop a conversational interface with custom intent detection, RAG, and multilingual support. I also had the opportunity to develop a hierarchical MLP classifier, which achieved a 98% F1 score with a 30% rate of inconclusive flagging.
